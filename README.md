# [Querynator](https://querynator.netlify.app/)

It's a mini implementation of how the query's results are shown to the users in an efficient way.

## Frameworks/packages

* This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* For UI, I have used [Material UI](https://mui.com).
* Stub :- [Querynator-backend API](https://github.com/Dhirajkumar55/atlan-querynator-backend) deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Usage

Use the node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the dependencies.
```bash
npm install 
```
To Run the app in the development mode.
```bash
npm start
```
Which would start the server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
